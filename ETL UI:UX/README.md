Note:

- This folder has the solution for a JS Engineering, UI/UX Design challenge.
- I have integrated the web service and JS challenges in this projects too.
- This application has two parts rest consumer and rest producer. 
- I developed the rest consumer using Angular7 and the rest producer using Spring Boot (2.1.8).
- I used H2 database as my storage.
- I used a tool called Intellij IDEA (for Spring Boot app) by JetBrains , Microsoft Visual Studio Code (for Angular) by Microsoft to code this specific project.

- Good Luck to me.

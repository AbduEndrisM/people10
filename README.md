Hi there,
This is Abdu Endris.
I have solved all the challenges within two days (the whole weekend).

As it is allowed to restructure the project I have done some modification.

1. I have done the JS challenge as requeired and populated the json data to a bootstrap table 
	with a click event.
2. I have done the web service challenge easily using Spring Boot and H2 in memory database.
	I have made the given sql data to be loaded automatically and I tested all the api's using Insomnia rest client.
	works perfectly!
3. I prefered to create a rest client and producer for the rest and also add some aditional functionalites. I prefered 
	developing Angular2 (coding-challenge-app) project as rest client and a SpringBoot project as rest producer (coding-challenge-api).
	So, I uploaded the given csv file (data1/data2) directly to a database (H2) and played with it. Search, Delete, List All, Add and Dashboard api's are done.
   

   Looking forward to hearing the feedback
